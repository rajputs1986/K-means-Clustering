Unsupervised - K-means clustering

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised ML algorithms. The objective of K-means is to group/cluster similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.
A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
You will define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
Every data point is allocated to a cluster through reducing the in-cluster sum of squares.
In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
The “means” in the K-means refers to averaging of the data to find the centroid.
